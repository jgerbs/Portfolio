      <h2>What Is a Keylogger?</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        A <strong>keylogger</strong> (short for “keystroke logger”) is a tool that records keys pressed on a keyboard.
        While sometimes used for authorized monitoring or usability testing, malicious keyloggers can secretly capture
        everything you type —
        such as passwords, personal messages, or financial information — without your knowledge.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Keyloggers can exist as hardware devices or software programs.
        Software keyloggers typically attach to keyboard input events, record each keystroke, and store or send that
        data elsewhere.
        This demo safely illustrates the concept by logging keystrokes only within the text box below, after you give
        explicit consent.
      </p>

      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Consent required:</strong>
        This demo runs entirely in your browser and does <em>not</em> send or store data anywhere.
        It only records keys from the text box once you press <strong>“Start Demo (I consent)”</strong>.
      </div>

      <h2>Simulated Environment</h2>
      <p class="muted">Type in this box once the demo starts to see how keystrokes are captured:</p>
      <textarea class="keylogger-input" id="demo-input" placeholder="Type here when demo is active..."></textarea>

      <div class="controls">
        <button id="start-btn">Start Demo (I consent)</button>
        <button id="stop-btn" disabled>Stop Demo</button>
      </div>

        <h3>Why Is This Dangerous?</h3>
        <p>
          Real keyloggers operate invisibly, recording everything you type and often sending that data to attackers.
          This could include login credentials, emails, and even credit card numbers.
          Even seemingly harmless browser extensions or applications can include hidden logging functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep your operating system, browser, and antivirus software up to date.</li>
          <li>Only download apps or extensions from trusted, verified sources.</li>
          <li>Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
          <li>Regularly review background tasks and network connections for suspicious activity.</li>
          <li>Educate yourself and others on how phishing and social engineering can lead to malware infections.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="muted extra-note">
          Remember — awareness and good digital hygiene are your best defense. This demo is a safe example of what
          happens when
          data is captured locally and ethically, but real-world attacks can happen without any visible signs.
