      <h2>What Is a Keylogger?</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        A <strong>keylogger</strong>, short for keystroke logger, is a tool that records what you type on a keyboard.
        While they can be used for things like authorized monitoring or usability testing, malicious keyloggers
        can secretly capture everything you type, including passwords, messages, or financial information,
        without you knowing.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Keyloggers can exist as either hardware devices or software programs.
        Software keyloggers usually attach themselves to keyboard input events, log each key press, and then store
        or transmit that data somewhere else.
        This demo shows the concept in a safe way by recording keystrokes only inside the text box below, and
        only after you choose to start the demo.
      </p>

      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Consent required:</strong>
        This demo runs entirely in your browser and does not send or store data anywhere.
        It only records what you type in the box after you press the Start Demo button.
      </div>

      <h2>Simulated Environment</h2>
      <p class="muted">Type in the box below once the demo is active to see how keystrokes are logged:</p>

        <h3>Why Is This Dangerous?</h3>
        <p>
          Real keyloggers stay hidden, recording everything you type and often sending that information to attackers.
          This can include usernames, passwords, emails, credit card numbers, and more.
          Even apps or browser extensions that seem harmless can contain hidden logging features.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep your operating system, browser, and antivirus software updated.</li>
          <li>Only install apps or extensions from trusted sources.</li>
          <li>Use strong and unique passwords, and enable multi-factor authentication.</li>
          <li>Check background tasks and network activity for anything unusual.</li>
          <li>Learn how phishing and social engineering can lead to malware infections.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="muted extra-note">
          Good awareness and digital hygiene are the strongest defense.
          This demo shows a safe and local example, but real-world keyloggers can be completely invisible.
