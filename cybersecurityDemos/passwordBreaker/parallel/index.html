            <h2>Heuristic Parallel Attack</h2>
            <p class="muted">
                This demonstration shows how modern PIN cracking works. 
                Instead of checking all values in order, the attack begins with a heuristic list of highly likely PINs. 
                These include common choices, patterns, sequences, keypad shapes, and birth years. 
                The list also contains the full range from 0000 to 9999 at the end so the system always finds the correct value.
            </p>

            <p class="muted">
                The list is divided between several worker threads. 
                Each thread searches its part of the list at the same time. 
                When any thread finds the match, all threads stop instantly.

                All processing happens on your device only.

                <h3>How the Heuristic Search Works</h3>

                <p class="muted">
                    Most people do not choose PINs at random. 
                    Attackers take advantage of this and check the most likely values first. 
                    The list used in this demo includes:
                </p>

                <ul class="muted">
                    <li>Common PINs like 1234, 1111, 0000</li>
                    <li>Repeating patterns such as AABB, ABAB, AAAA</li>
                    <li>Number sequences like 0123 and 9876</li>
                    <li>Keypad patterns based on phone or keyboard layouts</li>
                    <li>Years between 1950 and 2025</li>
                    <li>The full range from 0000 to 9999</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="muted">
                    The list is split evenly between multiple threads. 
                    Each thread works in parallel which greatly reduces the time needed to find a match. 
                    This is why four threads can complete the entire search much faster than a single thread.
                </p>

                <p class="muted">
                    When one worker discovers the correct PIN, it signals the main thread and all workers are stopped immediately.
                </p>
